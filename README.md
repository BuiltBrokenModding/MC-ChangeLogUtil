# Minecraft Error Log Utility

##About
Small Utility app that helps process crash logs into read-able information

##Goal
The concept behind this app is to help reduce junk in change logs in order to make them easier to understand. In simplier terms it removes the trees so the forest can be seen.

##Function 1        - Parse
Parse change logs to replace srg names with read-able names using a MCP config file

##Function 2        - Reduce
Look for duplicate entries to help understand the source of infinite loops

##Function 3        - Predict
Pick out mods that could be the source of the problem

##Function 4        - Simplify
Group stack calls to simple method entries sets to help understand the source of the problem
